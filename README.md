# Ongoing Thesis Project

The goal of this code is to model the RG transformation for the Random Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Quantum Spin Chain.

## The Procedure

To achieve this we have the class where we randomly generate a new chain each time it's called and we define methods to derive the energy of the system along with the strongest bonds in each step of the elimination transformation.
