This is the code I have writen to define the Random Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Spin Chain and the RG transformation (elimination transformation) for a non-zero temprature system. Currently there is an issue with what happens when the size of the chain falls to zero, and shows an error. I also need to change the distribution method for the bonds so it's an actual random distribution to properly study the RG flow.
